        name : "Stalin",
        age : 22,
        sex: "male"
    }

    for(let key in person) console.log(key)   // ---> This sentence will get the name of the property...not the value....for be able of acces the value, we have to use the bracket notation....

    //Accesing the value in each iteration

    for(let key in person) console.log(person[key]);    //---> This sentence will print the value of each property...
