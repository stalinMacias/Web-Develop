Using factory functions allows us to create as many objects as we need it...
This factory functions return an object with all its implementations, since its values to its methods...


    ***   In modern JS if the key name and value name are equals, we can only declare it once....
           also, for declare methods we can do it shorter, just writting the nameMethod and adding  () after... example: checkPrice()    ****

    Due to factory functions are only use to create objects, its not necessary to create the object itself, you can return the object structure directly in the return value!....

    Exaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaample applying factory functions to create cars....

    check the file called "2 - factory-functions.js"


Important Note:
    *** Its important to mention that factory functions are only a patter for create objects ***

    * Declaring factory functions we have to use by convention the camel Notation:
