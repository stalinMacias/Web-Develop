A object is a collection of key - value pairs....

A object can contains values different value types, another object [nested objects] and also functions!!!....
    *The "functions" that are declared inside an object are called "methods"



Example of an object with different value types, 1 nested object and 1 function....

//This is an example of how a simple object is created!....
//But for a better implementation, its more recommended use factory function or constructor function

        *** For checked this example, go to file "1 - objectExample.js" ***
