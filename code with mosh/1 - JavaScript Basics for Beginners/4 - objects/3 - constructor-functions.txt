The constructor function is another pattern to create objects....

This is an approach similar to how objects are declared in Java....


Working with constructor function we have to use the Pascal Notation:

OneTwoThreeFour....

The logic of this pattern its based on how the function its invoked...
At the moment of use the "new" keyword, happened 3 things, 
    1.- A new empty object is created
    2.- Set "this" keyword point to this new obejct created!
    3.- It'll return the object from the constructor function


        //Example:
    Go check the file "3 - constructor-function.js" to see the hole example!
