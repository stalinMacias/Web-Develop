*** JS Objects are dynamics, this means that its properties can be modified, since add new properties to delete its properties....

If you declare an object as a const, it doesnt mean you cannot update its properties, an object as a cons only dont let to reassign the entire object....

        * Add a new propertie to an object
    // For add a new propertie its just like setting a new value to an actual propertie...
       ...if the object doesnt find that propertie it'll create a new one!
    cons goly ={
        life : "",
        shield: ""
    }
    goly.damage = "";   //of this way you are adding the dmg propertie that wasnt declared on the object!


        *Delete a property from an object
    //For delete a property from an object exist the keyowrd "delete"

    delete nameObject.namePropertyToDelete;
