The easiest way of copy an object and applying ES6 standars is by using the "spread operator"


    Remember, the spread opearator take all the properties of an object and put all togheter in the place where you indicate...
    Like example:

    const circle = {
        radius : 1,
        color : "yellow"
    }

    anotherCircle = {...circle};    //Spread Operator for clone the object circle


    Remember: The spread operator have the following sintax: ...nameObjectToSpread

    ...nameObjectToSpread
