Ternary Operator or Conditional Operator

This operator allows us to assign a value depending in a condicion...
If the condition evaluatio's is true, the value will be the following after the "?" operator, but if the result is false, the value will be the following after the ":"

Sintaxis:

let nameVar = conditionToEvaluate ? resultIfTrue : resultIfFalse;


Example:

//Assign "approved" if the score is more than 70, otherwise, assign "failed"

let score = 75;
let status = score > 70 ? "approved" : "failed";
