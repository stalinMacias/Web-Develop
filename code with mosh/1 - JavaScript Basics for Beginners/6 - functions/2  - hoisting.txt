What is hoisting?

    Hoisting is the procces of moving functions declaration to the top of the file and its doing automaticlly by the JS engine...

Thats why we can call a function declaration from wherever of the file, it doesnt matter if we first make the call and after we define the function....

But this it cant be applied to function expressions, if we try to call a function expression before its declaration, we are gonna get an error, and this is because function declaration works as if it would be a constant or a variable.... so if we want to call a function expression, we have to declare it first and then make the call


    Wrong Error:

        run();
        let run = function(){};
    
    Rigth Example:
        let run = function(){};
        run();
