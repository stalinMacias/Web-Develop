In JS there are 2 ways of declare functions:

    1.- Function Declaration

        function nameFunction(){
            //Code...
        }
    
    2.- Function Expression  

        There are 2 kinds of these function:
            * Annonymous Function Expression
            * Named Function Expression

        Annonymous Function Expression:
            let var = function(){
                //Code
            };

        Named Function Expression:
            let var = function nameFunction(){
                //Code
            };

    Differences:
    
    The function declaration is used to define a normal function, the function expression is used to assign a function to a variable or a constant!

    If a function expression doesnt have a name, its called Annonymous Function Expression, but if its have a name, its called Named Function Expression

    The way of invoke a Function Expression is by the name of it constant or variable...

    Example:

        let run = function(){
            console.log("Run bitch");
        }

        run();  //Call the Annonymous Function Expression
