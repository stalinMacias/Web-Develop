In JS functions you can send as many arguments as you want, it doesnt matter if the function has declared  same amount of arguments to receibe

    Like Example:

    function sum(a,b){
        return a+b;
    }

    In the above function there has been declared only 2 parameteres, but we can send less or more if we want....

    sum(1,2,3,3);   //This sentence wouldnÂ´t give an error, but the function only will return the sum of the 2 first parameters....

    If we would like to make the sum of all the arguments that were sended, JS offer us a keyword called "arguments"....
    With this keyword we can acces to an object where are saved all the arguments that were receibed by the function...
    This object has an iterator, so we can use a for..of to iterate over the value's object
