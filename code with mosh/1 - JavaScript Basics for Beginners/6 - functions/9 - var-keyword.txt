When you create a variable using the "var" keyword, JS creates a global scope variable and also attach the variable to the window browser object!

The window browser object shouldnt be touch by variables or functions, becase some front end libraries work with it and if you attach things there, it could create a conflict!


Also when you create a function withou encapsulate it, the function is attach to the window object!....
