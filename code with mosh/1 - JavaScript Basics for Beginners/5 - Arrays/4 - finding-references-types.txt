for make a search of references types in an array, we cant use the same methods as we used for find primitive types.... instead we use the following methods:


- find Method:

    * Sintaxis: 
    
    nameArr.find(function(element){
        return element.propertyOfTheValueWeAreLookingFor = valueWhatWeAreLookingFor;
    })

    * Description: 
    This method use a callback function that returns an undefined when the element indicated was not found, and if the element was found returns the hole object (reference type)...

    If the element was found, returns the hole object, it means, the function returns an object!...


    * Example:

    Check the file called 4 - finding-reference-types.js


-findIndex Method 

    It works exactly as the find Method, the only difference is the sintax and the value this function returns...

    This function returns the index where the element is located, ej : If the element we are looking for is locate in the object that is placed at index 3, the return value will be 3...
    buuuuuuuuuuuuuuut, if the element was not found, it will return a -1 ....

    * Sintaxis:

        nameArr.findIndex(function(element){
            return element.propertyOfTheValueWeAreLookingFor = valueWhatWeAreLookingFor;
        });


    * Example:

        check same file that is mention in find method...
