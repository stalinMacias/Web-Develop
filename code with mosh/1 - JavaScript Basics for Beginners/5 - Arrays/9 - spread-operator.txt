Here we go again with the powerful spread operator...

The spread operator allows us to combined and make a copy of an array...


    //Combining arrays with the spread operator

    const arr1 = [1,2,3];
    const arr2 = [4,5,6];

    const combinedArrays = [...arr1, ...arr2, 'a',2];

    As you can see in the example above, besides combined the 2 arrays, when we use the spread operator, we are not limited to only can combine 2 arrays, we also can add more elements to the new combinedArray ....

    //Making a copy of an array using the spread operator

    cont arr = [1,2,3,4];

    const copy = [...arr];

    In the example above, the spread operator spreads all the values of the array arr....
