There are different ways of emptying an array:



//First Solution
If the array only have 1 reference, this is the best practice and also if the array is declared a let not as constant:

    arr = [];

//Second Solution
If the array have multiple references and you want to affect all of them, this is the best approach:

    arr.length = 0;

    * Note:

Also you can use the splice method, but its a little bit tricky, thats why the second solution is the best practice...
