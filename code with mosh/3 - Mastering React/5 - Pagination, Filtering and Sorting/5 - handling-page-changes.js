/*
    The method where every updates will be done it has to be in the parent component, the child component only has to make the raising event (and in case of the method requires an argument, them have to be send since the raising event!)....

    In order to manipulate correctly the pagination, there are some important aspect you have to take in count:
    1.- A variable for track the actual page....
    2.- Stand out the actual page in the pagination bar... ---> This can be easily done by assigning dinamically the class call active.... the way of do it is comparing the current page that itll be send since the parent component with each page that it'll be render... and when match it, just add this class to the classNames....
        
    Important Note: the className that should be assign dinamically is the "page-item"....
        <li className="page-item">          <---- And that class has to be inside this element!
