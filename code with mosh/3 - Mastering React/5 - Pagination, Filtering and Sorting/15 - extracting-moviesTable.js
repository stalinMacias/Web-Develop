/*
    As a convention, at the beginin of each functional component we do the props destructring, of this way, taking a fast look at this part of the code, we can get an idea of what interface of this component looks like...


    The best code practice is to implement same abstraction level in our components... if we have 2 high level abstraction component and 1 low level abstraction compoment, or even worse an element in the same parent component, we need to increase the abstraction level for work with same levels....
