lodash has an incredible method for get nested properties, and it is very easy to use....


The method is call get() and takes 2 parameters:
    1.- the object where the property will be taken
    2.- the name of the property you want to take, it doesnt matter if is nested or not!

Sintax:
    _.get(objectToTakeProp,nameProp)
