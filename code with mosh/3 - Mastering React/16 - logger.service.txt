    *** Implementing the Logger Service ***
            Before anything, we need to init the Logger Service in the index.js file...
        1.-  in index.js import and init the Logger Service:
                ---> import Logger from "logService.js"
        2.-  before the ReactDom.render() statement, call the init method of our Logger Service:
                ---> Logger.init();
        3.- In those files/components where you'll need to track the errors, import again the Logger Service:
                ---> import Logger from "logService.js"
        4.- Wherever you will need to track the errors call the log() method and send them the error that was thrown!
                ---> Logger.log(error)
        5.- The last step is to check in the Sentry Dashboard of you project if the errors are being tracked correctly!


    What are the beneffits of create a Logger Service?
        - All the implementation details for managing the Logs are in the same place.
        - Anywhere you'll need to Log something, you only need to call the log() method, you dont will polute your code with code to create the Log
        - If in the future you decide to change your Log Service Provider, you'll only need to make changes in one file!
