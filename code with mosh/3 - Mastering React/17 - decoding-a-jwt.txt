*** Decoding a JSON Web Token ***
For decode a JWT we can use libraries, in this project we will use "jwt-decode library"

    * Install jwt-decode library
1.- Type the next command:                  --->    npm i jwt-decode@2.2.0
2.- Import the function that decodes a JWT  --->    import jwtDecode from 'jwt-decode';
3.- When the function will be used, we need to send it a JWT....
    3.1 - Get the JWT that is stored in the localStorage
        const jwt = localStorage.getItem("token'sKeyName");
    3.2 - Send the jwt to the function
        const data = jwtDecode(jwt);

    3.3 - Prevent exception when there is not JWT in the localStorage
        * If we try to get a token from the localStorage but there is nothing and then we send that object to the function to decode it, the app will throw an exception....
        That is why we have to wrap the code of point 3 in a try-catch block.....


* Where to decode a JWT?
The best place to do it is in the App.js file, because this is the main component of the tree component, and since this file we can send the token's data to another components...
