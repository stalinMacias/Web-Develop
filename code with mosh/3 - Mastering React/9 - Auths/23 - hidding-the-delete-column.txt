Hiding a column depending on the type of user is login it's not a big deal, one easy solution for this is by adding a constructor where we have to verify the type of user is currently login....
    * Remember: If you create a constructor(), then you have to call the super() method inside it!

Inside the constructor we verify what kind of user it is login and if it's an Admin user, we will add the deleteColumn to our columns array....
In this way, if the user is an Admin, the deleteColumn will be added to the columns array before it is sent to the Table Component...., if it is not an Admin, the deleteColumn won't be added!
