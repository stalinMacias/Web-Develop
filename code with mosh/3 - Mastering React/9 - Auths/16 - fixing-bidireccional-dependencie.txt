A bidirectional dependency occurs when in 2 modules we have in each one a dependencie from the other one....

In these cases, we need to analyze which one is more essential to remove the dependencies from the other one on it...
For example, if the http module is more important than the auth service, we will remove the dependency of the auth service in the http service!

Doing this, only the auth service will depend of the http service.....

One way to remove a bidirectional dependency is by reversering the logic that is currently being applied, for example, ...

    In the httpService we remove all dependencies of authService, and we will create a set() method that will create the commons headers with the JWT.....
    This means that in our authService we will need to call this set() method....
    Of this way, in our httpService there are no more dependencies of the authService....
