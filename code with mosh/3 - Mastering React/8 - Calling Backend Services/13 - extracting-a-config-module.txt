    Create a config module can be very helpful in order to encapsulate all info that could be use in many parts of our app....

    One example it could be the url where the backend calls are made... this url can be used in many parts of our app...

    So... we create a new file called  "config.json"    --->    It has to be .json cause what it'll be inside its an JS Object, wich will have properties with values....

    Like example, if we are encapsulating the url, our config.json file would look like this:

    {
        "url": "baseURL",
        "anotherProp": "value"
    }
        * Take spetial care when you are creating the properties, because you have to defined their name inside a ""... as if you would be typing a string value!


    As any other module, in each file where we will need to acces some info that is inside of this file, we need to import this module!

    The way of accesing each property is by doth "." notation, because at the end of the day when you import this module, it'll be treath as an object!
