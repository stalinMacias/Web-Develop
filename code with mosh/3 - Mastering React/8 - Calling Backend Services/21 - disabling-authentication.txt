    In order to be able of send data to the backend server, we need to disable the authentication that is to true by default...

    Goes to "config" folder and open "default.json" file, there is a property call "requiresAuth" and is set to true, just change it to false and everything should works!

    Before start to work, we need to install "Postman" chrome extention....

   
    * Once you've installed it, lets test the "Get" method, just for test if the backend is working properly!....

        1.- Open Postman
        2.- Type the url where the server is running and also includes the extention where you want to get the data from!
            Example: Getting data from movies!
            http://localhost:3900/api/movies
        3.- Check if the server returns the data!


    * After testing the "get" method, we will send a "post" request to the server for add a new movie!
        1.- Use the same url that you use in the example above!
        2.- Change the "get" option to the "post" option....
        3.- Go to "Body" section, select the "raw" option and change the format of "text" to -> "JSON(application/json)"
        4.- Write the object we want to send, remember that JSON notation requires every key is written inside "", example:

            {"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}
        5.- Click the Send button, if you did everything correct, you should not get any error!
