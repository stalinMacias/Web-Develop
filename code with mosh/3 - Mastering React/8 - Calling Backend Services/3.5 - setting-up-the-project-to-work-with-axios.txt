    Before start making calls to the backend, there are some configurations we have to do....

1.- Define the url ... There are many options, but the most elegant is:
    - Create a new file called "config.json" and inside of it, create a new JS Object with the property "ulr" and as value the address where the backend server is running, Example:
        {"baseURL": "localhost:3900/api/"}

    Here we are creating the baseURL wich will be prepended to the url of each table where data is stored!

    This is very helpful, because we will only need to define the "relative path" in each module depending from in wich tabla the data we need is stored!...
    Example:
    Let's supose I need to get data from the movies table
        baseURL: "localhost:3900/api/"  ---> It'll be prepended to url value!
        url: "/movies"                  ---> It'll be added to baseURL for complete the URL where the data is stored!
    As you can see, we only need to specify the missing url info for get the data from the movies table!

    *** Another option for specify the URL where the data should be taken/send is by appending the url after the baseURL inside the axios call:
        axios.method(baseURL + "/" + "missingURL")....
