    What is a Toast Notification?
        - Its a beatiful way to replace the default alert() method providen by JS...
    
    How to install Toast?
        1.- Since the terminal run the next command:    ---> npm i react-toastify@â–²4.1
        2.- Mount the toast containter:                 ---> import {ToastContainer} from "react-toastify";
                                                             inside the render() method:    
                                                                <ToastContainer />
        If you dont have an idea where to mount the ToastContainer, the best place is in the render method of the root file... (In the app.js) module!                                                        
        3.- Import the css library in the same module where the ToastContainer was imported:    ---> import "react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css";
        4.- In every place where you have the need to throw an alert(), you can replace it for toast and all its method that offered us....
                                                        ---> import {toast} from "react-toastify";

        5.- Replace in the code all the alert() methods for the toast method....
            alert(msg) ---> toast(msg)
        
        6.- if there is the need to show a toast alert depending the kind of error, we can select one of the methods that this object offered us...
            Some of them are:   
                - error
                - success
            
            Sintaxis:
            nameFunction = (error) =>{
                toast.error(error);
                //But also you can use the toast method as a function!
                toast(error)
            }
