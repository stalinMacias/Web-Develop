    When you are creating the Route Navigation remember to wrap all Route components in a Switch Component.
    After all the Route components you can implement the Redirect Components.
        * if you are gonna define a Redirect component to redirect from the route url ("/") remember to add the exact attribute, otherwise, all url will be redirected to the url defined in this component!

    
    *** Route component sintax ***
    <Route path="/url" component={Component}>

    *** Redirect component sintax ***
        - Redirecting from a url to another one:
            <Redirect from="/" exact to="url">
            
        -Redirecting when any Route neither Redirect components matched:    This is commonly use to redirect to an error page or not found page!
            <Redirect to="/url-errorPage">
