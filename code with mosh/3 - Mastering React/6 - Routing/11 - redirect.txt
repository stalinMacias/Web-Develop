    Redirect can be used of 2 ways:
    1.- For redirect to a specific component when any Route component matched:
        * At the end of the <Route /> components add: <Redirect to="/urlToRedirect" />
        
        This option is normally use to redirect the url to a Not Found page or something equivalent!

    2.- For redirect from an url that is not include in the Route components to another URL that has already included in some Route component:  
    <Redirect from="/urlNotIncluded" to="/urlInclued">


    In simple words, the Redirect component takes the given url and create a new one with the value in its to="" property....

    Example:

    <Redirect to="/error">

    The Redirect component above will replace the given URL into a /error 
    **************************************************************************

    <Redirect from="music" to="/playlist">

    The Redirect component above will replace the given URL /music into /playlist

************************************************************************************

Its very important to have a Route component for each Redirect component, at the end, the Redirect component will create a new URL, and its require that one Route component has defined in its  path="" attribute the URL that the Redirect component will create in order to show the desired component...

    *** One last thing, import the Redirect module ****
    *.- import {Redirect} from 'react-router-dom';
