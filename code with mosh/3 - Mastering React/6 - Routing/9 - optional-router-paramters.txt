    For make optional the router parameters, we only need to add a "?" after each parameter, of this way is how JS regular expression works...

    This will allow us to call our components without the need of send to them all the parameters....


    --- <Route path="/something/:param1?/:param2?" component={<Component />}>

    
    Remember how to read the Route parameters:
        Them are receibed in the props object....

Accesing each Route parameter....
    --- props.match.params.nameParameter  ---
