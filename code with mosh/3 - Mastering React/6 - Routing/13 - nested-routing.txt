    Nested Routing happen when we have routing in the top and in the bottom....
    This means that when you are working in an app where makes a route and the component that was render after that route have its own routes...
    Like example:
        You have an app with a list of options, and you select one option, if the component that it'll be rendered also have its own options to render another component depending each one, that is called Nested Routing....

    
    *** The most important of this lesson is to understand that Route component can be used in any place of the application, not only in the App.js ***
    Remember, Route component is just one more component with spetial props....


    By general, the Route component of the Nested Routing will have in its path at the beginning the url of its parent component...
    Like example:
        If you need to render the option that was selected for an admin, the path of each option should look like this:

            <Route path="/admin/option1" component={option1} />
            <Route path="/admin/option2" component={option2} />

    *** Remember: each <Link to="/url"> in order to be routed correctly needs to have a <Route > component with same url in its <Route path="/url" component={component}> attribute....
