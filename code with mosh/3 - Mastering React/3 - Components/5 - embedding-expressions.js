/*
    The most important of this lessons are the next 2 points:

    1.- we can perfectly define JS expressions inside a JSX... the way of do it is by adding {} and inside of them write the JS expression....
        Example:
        <span>{this.object.value}</span>    //Getting the value of an object of the actual class (object!)
        <span>{this.method()}</span>        //Calling a method of the actual class (object!)

    2.- we can type JSX code togheter JS code...the way of do it is just by adding the JSX code as normal!
        Example:
        if(value === true) return <h1>The value is true</h1>    //Returning a h1 JSX element depending a conditional!....
