            Rendering a Component

As well as some React Elements represent DOM tags like div,h1,span....

    const element = <div />;

Also the user-defined components are React Elements....

    const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;    //Welcome is the component ... name="Sara" will be send as an object to the Welcome component.... 
                                                //The component Welcome will receibe the object specifically with the name of "props".....

*** When React sees that are properties after a component, those arguments are send as a single object call "props"



Check the next example and read its explanation:

function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(element,document.getElementById('root'));

1.- We call ReactDOM.render() with the <Welcome name="Sara" /> element.
2.- React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props.
3.- Our Welcome component returns a <h1>Hello, Sara</h1> element as the result.
4.- React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match <h1>Hello, Sara</h1>.
