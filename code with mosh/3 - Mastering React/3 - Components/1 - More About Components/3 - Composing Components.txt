            Composing Components

Components can refer to other components in their output.
This means that we can create a component by calling other components in the render() method of the Compose Component! 

    -For example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times:


function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}

In this example, App is the Compose Component, and in its render() method, it is calling several times the Welcome Component!
