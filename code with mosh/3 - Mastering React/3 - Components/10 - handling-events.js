/*
    The way of handle events of DOM Elements (buttons,radio buttons, etc...) is by the methods on....

    This means, you have to type in JSX elements the keyword "on" and wait for the suggestions that VSCode gives you, or if you know the exactly name of the event you will implement, go ahead and type it by yourself!....

    * Events are case sensitives.... example:    react event: onClick={callMethodToHandle}....

    -----Super Important------ As you can see, the way of calling the method where the event will be handled is by referencing...this means...not using ()

    By convention, we have to create a method for handle what the event should do.... and the name of that methods should beggin with handle....
    example:
    hanldeIncrementButton(){}
    handleExitButton(){}

    ......

    Example:
                 onClick={callMethodToHandle}
