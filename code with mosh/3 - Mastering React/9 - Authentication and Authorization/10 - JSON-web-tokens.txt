    What is a JSON web token?
A JSON Web Token is generated in the server indicating the user's privileges and send it to the client!
Once the client has received the token, it can use it for prove what privileges have the current user
The token has the signature of the server, so, both, client and server can verify that the token is legitim

*********************************************************************

A JSON Web Token is compound of three sections:
    - HEADER            --->    This section defines the algorithm that was used to generate the token and the Token Type
    - PAYLOAD           --->    This section has all the data of the token, (All the info that is returned by the server)
    - VERIFY SIGNATURE  --->    This section is purely the signature, The programmer can't do anything with this... is manipulated by the server itself!

*********************************************************************

*** Decoding a JSON Web Token ***
As I mentioned in the text above, the PAYLOAD section has the data that the server is returning, a programmer can decode that section and extract the data in order to work with it!
The data is stored as an object.... "key":"value"
