Following the logic of how we determine if a user is login or not, we will code the logout component!

If there is a token in the localStorage it means the user is logged, so, if we want to log out the user we will need to remove its token from the localStorage....


* The component that it'll be created does not need to display anything, so in the render method we can return a null....
* The only task of this component it'll be to remove the token from the localStorage and redirect the page to the main page...
