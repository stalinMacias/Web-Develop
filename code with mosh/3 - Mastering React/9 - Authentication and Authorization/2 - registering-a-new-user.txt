    The backend of this application it'll return two possible states:
        - 200 if everything went right
        - 400 if an user has already been registered
    
    For making calls to the backend we need an endpoint where the users will be registered.
    These calls will use the "post" method

    In this specific application, to register an user, we need to send the next data:
        - email
        - password
        - name
