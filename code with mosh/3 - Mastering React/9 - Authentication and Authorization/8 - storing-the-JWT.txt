*** Storing the JSON Web Token ***

Every browser has a local database called "localstorage" in which you can save temporary data!

That is what we are going to do, save the JWT in there!

// Saving something in the localstorage
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
    As you can see, this method takes 2 strings as parameteres

//Checking the localstorage in the browser
    For check what the localstorage has, we can do it in the option Application -> Storage -> Local Storage of the chrome development tools
