The server returns headers after a "post" call, this header contains information about the result of the call.
Any header that starts with "x" it'll be treated as a "custom header" which are not part of the http protocol

    Buuut, before continuous, what is a HTTP Header?
        * HTTP headers are the code that transfers data between a Web server and a browser. 
        * HTTP headers are mainly intended for the communication between the server and client in both directions.


There is a little problem with custom headers, by its own them can't be read in the browser, we have to create a new standard header that it will display the content of the custom header....

    Example:
 
.header("x-auth-token",token)                               //This a custome header
.header("access-control-expose-headers", "x-auth-token")    //Creating a standard http header for let the client read the custom header


After updating the backend service to make custom headers can be read in the browser, we need to access these headers....
In a http request, headers are in the promise that is returned by the server!


    Example of how to access the value of the header we have just created!

const response = await registerUser(this.state.data);               //Saving the result of the server
localStorage.setItem("token", response.headers["x-auth-token"]);    //Accesing the specifically header we need and save it in the localStorage....
