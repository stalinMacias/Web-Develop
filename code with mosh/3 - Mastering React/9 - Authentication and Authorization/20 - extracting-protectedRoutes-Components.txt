    When we work with Route components there are 2 essentiallty attributes:
        - The Path
        - A component or the render attribute

    Creating an extractable component that will be aware of the current user and dependending on it, show a component o redirect to the login page will need to receive:
        - Path
        - Component
        - render method()
        - other props that the component may require for render correctly
    
    * This component will receive a Component and a render method just in case if the Component is null, the render method it'll be load instead!

    * The rest of the props will be spread in the Route component not in the Component neither the render attribute that it was received by the method

    *** Its output will be a standar Route react component ***





Remember:   React expects that the component's name starts with a Capital Letter....
