When you create a project with the command:     npx create-react-app name-app 

The result is a folder with all files needed, you can start the development server typing the command:  npm start

Once the app is open in the browser, each change that you make will be reflect automaticly when you save them!

In order to create our first react app from scratch, we need to delete every files of src folder.... and create a new index.js

Steps to create our first react app from scratch:
    1.- Inside the new index.js we need to make the needly imports....

        import React from 'react';          //Importing the object React from the module 'react'
        import ReactDom from "react-dom";   //Importing the object ReactDom from the module 'react-dom'
    
    2.- Declare a constant assigning a JSX value that will be display in its corresponding DOM element!

        const element = <h1>Hello World</h1>;
    
    3.- Render the new element in the RealDom....

        ReactDom.render(element,document.getElementById("idWhereTheElementWillBeDiplayed"));

And thats all that we need to do in our index.js file!


    About the RealDom....
    In the index.html we have to create a container where our react element will be displayed!.... its easy as follows:

    <div id="containerToDiplayReactElements"></div>

And thats all, in the index.js when the element will be render, it has to use the id defined for this container!
