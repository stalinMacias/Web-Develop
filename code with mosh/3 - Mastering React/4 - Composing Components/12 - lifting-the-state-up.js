/*

    Lifting the state up means to set the state of a component to its parent...
    As well when you set the state in the parent, you also need to set those methods that modifies or update the state.....

    Once the parent have the state and the methods, you have to send them to it childs by props....
    For acces the methods, you'll send the reference for raising the event
    for access the state property, you'll need to send the state itself...

    And in the child component, you have to make the corresponding modifies in order to make everything works as it would do it!
    ...................
    If previosly the component where the state is defined was used as a compose component, you'll have to modify the way of send raising methods and data to its childs, because that component will no longer have state neiter methods....

    The grandchild wont be affected by this changes doing the right implementation.....

    
    *** Note ***

    If you are gonna lifting up the state into the App.js file that is created by default for react, you should modifiy it a litle bit, instead of declare a function, you have to work with a Class, as you have been working with others components!
