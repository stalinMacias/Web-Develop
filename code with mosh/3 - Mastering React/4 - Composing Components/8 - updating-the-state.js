/*

    At some point, it'll be inneficient and noisy the fact of send each parameter from the compose component to the single component, thats why, when we are sending multiple properties from an object, its better to send the whole object, of this way, you only send one argument instead of send every single property from the object by themselves....

    Anyways, if you are sending the whole object, its properties will be accessible using its name (key)....
