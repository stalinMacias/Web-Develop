/***
 *          Differences between props and states:
 *
 *  props include data that we send to a component... these are the inputs from a component... props aren't modifiable (them are read only!).... props is an object with all input to a component... each input is a property from the object...
 *
 *  state includes data that is local and private to a component.... other components cant acces to state...
 *
 *
 *  The closest aproach for be able of modify a prop is by assign it into a state property and then update that state property!.....
