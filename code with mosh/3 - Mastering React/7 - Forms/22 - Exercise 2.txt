    Task to do:

    1.- Add a new button in movies form, when its clicked, goes to /movies/new where there will be a form with 4 inputs:

            - title
            - genre:            a list with the next genres: Action, Comedy, Thriller
            - number in stock:  a number between 0 and 100
            - rate:             a number between 0 and 10
        
    Take in mind that this form it'll be the same when we need to update (modify) a movie!.... Advice: Check the url parameter and determine if you are adding a new movie or modifing an existing one!

    if the url parameter doesnt comply the condition for determine if we are adding a new movie and also its not a valid movie id or key or whatever you use for determine a valid movie, redirect the page to the: /not-found .... This task should be done in the componentDidMount() method because you will call the server once the render method has been executed...

    Once the save button has been clicked:

        1.- Add the new movie in the server! (consume the MoviesAPI!)
        2.- redirect to /movies

    * Fix the implementation of the handleDelete() because as it has be done, just delete the movie from the local state, not from the server!
