    In many forms implementation, you will need some input elements...
    Those inputs almost all the times have the same pattern(same info), that is why extracting and creating a new reusable component is a good idea...
    Of this way, each time you'll need to add a new input, you just will call the Input component you have abstracted and send them the required info for the new input!


    At this point, you should be able of detect what info is required to abstract in order to create the new component, and of course, you alse must know how to do it!....
