route:  ---> Route

        React is just a library responsible for rendering the view, that is why we need to install an extra library call: react-router-dom
        - Installing react-router-dom:  npm i react-router-dom@4.3.1

        *** Just as general knowledge, there is another library call: react-router-native for handle the routing in native applications ***

    After install the react-router-dom library, we need to do 2 more steps:

        1.- In the index.js file we need to import the component {BrowserRouter}:
                import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';
        
            After importing, we need to wrap the component that is being rendered in the ReactDom.render(<Component/>, doc....) in a <BrowserRouter> component

            It'll looks like this:
                ReactDom.render(<BrowserRouter><Component/></BrowserRouter>,docu....);
            
        2.- Register our Route, this means that we will tell react what component should be rendered based on a given url...

                For render a component based on a given url, we need to use the Route Component....
                For be able of use the Rout component, we need to import it:

                    import {Route} from 'react-router-dom';
                
                After importing the Route component, we need to register the Route components, this basically means we need to define Route components and assign their corresponding attributes... it has 2 attributes that it'll be passed as props:
                    1.- path=""         ---> The url
                    2.- component={}    ---> The component that sould be rendered base on the url
            
            Example: If you want to render the Products component based on its url, it'll looks like this:

                <Route path="/products" component={Products} />

How to install Toast?   ---> Beatiful alert notifications

1.- Since the terminal run the next command:    ---> npm i react-toastify@â–²4.1
2.- Mount the toast containter:                 ---> import {ToastContainer} from "react-toastify";
                                                        inside the render() method:    
                                                        <ToastContainer />
If you dont have an idea where to mount the ToastContainer, the best place is in the render method of the root file... (In the app.js) module!                                                        
3.- Import the css library in the same module where the ToastContainer was imported:    ---> import "react-toastify/dist/ReactToastify.css";
4.- In every place where you have the need to throw an alert(), you can replace it for toast and all its method that offered us....
                                                ---> import {toast} from "react-toastify";

5.- Replace in the code all the alert() methods for the toast method....
    alert(msg) ---> toast(msg)

6.- if there is the need to show an toast alert depending the kind of error, we can select one of the methods that this object offered us...
    Some of them are:   
        - error
        - success
    
    Sintaxis:
    nameFunction = (error) =>{
        toast.error(error);
        //But also you can use the toast method literrally as a function!
        toast(error)
    }
