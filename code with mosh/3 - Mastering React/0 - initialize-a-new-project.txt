1.- Create a new React Project
2.- Install the version 4.1.1 of bootstrap since the terminal! : --->   npm i bootstrap@4.1.1
3.- Import bootstrap in index.js : --->                                 import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"

route:

        React is just a library responsible for rendering the view, that is why we need to install an extra library call: react-router-dom
        - Installing react-router-dom:  npm i react-router-dom@4.3.1

        *** Just as general knowledge, there is another library call: react-router-native for handle the routing in native applications ***

    After install the react-router-dom library, we need to do 2 more steps:

        1.- In the index.js file we need to import the component {BrowserRouter}:
                import {BrowserRouter} from 'react-router-dom';
        
            After importing, we need to wrap the component that is being rendered in the ReactDom.render(<Component/>, doc....) in a <BrowserRouter> component

            It'll looks like this:
                ReactDom.render(<BrowserRouter><Component/></BrowserRouter>,docu....);
            
        2.- Register our Route, this means that we will tell react what component should be rendered based on a given url...

                For render a component based on a given url, we need to use the Route Component....
                For be able of use the Rout component, we need to import it:

                    import {Route} from 'react-router-dom';
                
                After importing the Route component, we need to register the Route components, this basically means we need to define Route components and assign their corresponding attributes... it has 2 attributes that it'll be passed as props:
                    1.- path=""         ---> The url
                    2.- component={}    ---> The component that sould be rendered base on the url
            
            Example: If you want to render the Products component based on its url, it'll looks like this:

                <Route path="/products" component={Products} />
