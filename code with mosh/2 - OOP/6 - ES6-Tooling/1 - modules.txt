The main benefits of apply modularity are the following:

    Maintainability
    Reuse
    Abstraction

A module is a file with a specific part of code that do something and can be exported to be reused in other files!


    There are 2 types of modules:

    1.- CommonJS    ---> Works in Node.JS 
    2.- ES6 Modules ---> Works in the Browser


    An imporant aspect of modularity is: Things that are highly related should go together

    Everything inside a module is private... unlees we explicited export it!
