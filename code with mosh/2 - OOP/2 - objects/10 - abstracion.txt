Abstraction means hide the details and complexity and only show the essentials

This will make your code cleaner and easier to mantain, like example, when you are calling a method that shouldnt be able of being called outside the object, if you modify that method, you'll have to modify all lines where that method was called, in contrast... if you apply abstraction and you make a change at that method, you only will modify the line where that method is called from inside the object!....

Mental note: Remember the DVD example!...
