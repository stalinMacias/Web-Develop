Objects created by a given constructor function will have the same prototype (The Constructor Function Itself!!!)....

And the prototype of the constructor function it'll be the te object prototype....

This allows to each object inherit from its prototype... and if one object inherit from its prototype, and its prototype inherit from its own prototype, the object can inherit from the prototype of it prototype
