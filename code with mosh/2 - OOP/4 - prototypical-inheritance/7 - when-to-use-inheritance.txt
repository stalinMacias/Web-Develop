Apply inheritance to your project shoul be something you really think twice, some times its dont really needly to do it...
But if you are gonna do it, keep it simple, Avoid creating inheritance hierarchies, this means, only apply inheritance at one level: parent - child... just that!


There is a thecnique named Composition that can replace inheritance....
Favor Composition over inheritance....
With this thecnique you can create new Objects as you need without any problem

    For achieve Composition in JS we can use Mixins!
