        A new feature of ES6 is the template literal. This is a special type of string that makes creating complex strings easier.

        Template literals allow you to create multi-line strings and to use string interpolation features to create strings.

        // Template literal with multi-line and string interpolation
        const greeting = `Hello, my name is ${person.name}!
        I am ${person.age} years old.`;

        console.log(greeting); // prints
        // Hello, my name is Zodiac Hasbro!
        // I am 56 years old.

                                        ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        * Explicaci√≥n y Caracteristicas del Template Literals
            -The example uses backticks (`), not quotes (' or "), to wrap the string. 
            -Secondly, notice that the string is multi-line, both in the code and the output. This saves inserting \n within strings.
        

        The ${variable} syntax used above is a placeholder. Basically, you won't have to use concatenation with the + operator anymore. To add variables to strings, you just drop the variable in a template string and wrap it with ${ and }. Similarly, you can include other expressions in your string literal, for example ${a + b}.

        This new way of creating strings gives you more flexibility to create robust strings.
