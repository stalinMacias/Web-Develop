        Like in Java, using the * when importing brings everycode available for be imported

        It means, if X file exports 4 functions, when using * for import in a file Y, it inmediatly let you use the 4 functions....


        Sintaxis:

        import * as object_with_name_of_your_choice from "file_path_goes_here"

        Use the imported function:
        
        object_with_name_of_your_choice.imported_function
