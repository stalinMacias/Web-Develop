            The difference is that import allows us to choose which parts of a module or file load into a given file!....
            In other words, using import we can select what portion of code that is saved in X file, we want to bring into a Y file...


            The require didnt allow do this, require bring everything when it was invoked!


            Example:

            import { countItems } from "math_array_functions"

            Description of the example:

                import { function } from "file_path_goes_here"
                // We can also import variables the same way!.


                                                Note
        In most cases, the file path requires a ./ before it; otherwise, node will look in the node_modules directory first trying to load it as a dependency.



    Example applying the import method:


    import { capitalizeString } from "string_functions";
    "use strict";
    capitalizeString("hello!");
